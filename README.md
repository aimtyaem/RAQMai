 **AI-Powered VR/AR Training and Simulation System for Space Tourists Enhanced with Real-time Data Intelligence**

## About the Project

The QuantumMind AI project leverages state-of-the-art virtual and augmented reality technologies combined with advanced AI to create a fully immersive training environment for space tourism. By integrating Perplexity's Sonar model, the system now provides real-time, web-grounded intelligence and data analysis capabilities, enhancing the simulation accuracy and educational value. This system simulates every phase of the space tourism experience with unprecedented fidelity, offering a cutting-edge approach to preparing space tourists for the realities of space travel.

## Key Components

- **Immersive VR Environment**: Photorealistic space environments rendered in high fidelity
- **Augmented Reality Overlays**: Real-time information and guidance systems
- **AI-Powered Personalization**: Adaptive training modules based on user performance
- **Sonar Intelligence Integration**: Real-time data processing from satellite feeds and web sources
- **Auto SmallSat Data Router**: Direct integration with orbital data sources for authentic simulations

## Sonar Model Integration

The QuantumMind AI system now incorporates Perplexity's Sonar API to enhance training scenarios with:

## Dev Installation Guidelines

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aimtyaem/RA-Space-exploration.git
   cd RA-Space-exploration
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # OR
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Sonar API Integration:**
   ```javascript
   // Create a .env file with your Sonar API credentials
   SONAR_API_KEY=your-api-key
   SONAR_API_BASE=https://api.perplexity.ai
   ```

4. **Sonar Model Setup:**
   ```python
   # Python implementation example
   from openai import OpenAI
   
   client = OpenAI(
     api_key="your-sonar-api-key",
     base_url="https://api.perplexity.ai"
   )
   
   def generate_space_insight(prompt):
     response = client.chat.completions.create(
       model="perplexity/sonar-pro",
       messages=[
         {"role": "system", "content": "You are a space training assistant."},
         {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
       ],
       temperature=0.7,
       max_tokens=1000
     )
     return response.choices[0].message.content
   ```

5. **JavaScript Integration:**
   ```javascript
   // For web-based VR/AR applications
   import { OpenAI } from 'openai';
   
   const sonarClient = new OpenAI({
     apiKey: process.env.SONAR_API_KEY,
     baseURL: 'https://api.perplexity.ai'
   });
   
   async function getSpaceData(query) {
     const completion = await sonarClient.chat.completions.create({
       model: 'perplexity/sonar-pro',
       messages: [
         { role: 'system', content: 'You assist with space training simulations.' },
         { role: 'user', content: query }
       ],
       temperature: 0.7
     });
     return completion.choices[0].message.content;
   }
   ```

6. **Run the Application:**
   - Launch the VR/AR client application using the respective game engine's development environment
   - Ensure Sonar API connectivity is properly configured
   - Test the integration between the VR environment and Sonar intelligence features

## SmallSat Data Integration

The system now connects directly to orbital data sources through the Auto SmallSat network, routing real-time space environment data to enhance training simulations:

- Environmental conditions (radiation, temperature, pressure)
- Visual data from Earth observation
- Space weather alerts and conditions
- Grid energy metrics for spacecraft power management simulations
